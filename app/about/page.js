<p className="text-4xl text-black mb-8 mx-178 text-justify">
  We started this website as a group of students working on a school project. At first, it was just about passing a subject—but along the way, we realized it could be something bigger.
  Instead of being just our personal blog, DailyBlogs is designed as a space where anyone can share their thoughts, stories, and ideas.<br /><br />
  For us, this project is a way to explore coding, learn how real websites work, and experiment with building something useful for others. But for you, it’s a platform to express yourself.
  Whether it’s about your day, your passions, or something you’re learning, DailyBlogs gives you a place to write, share, and connect.  At the core, DailyBlogs is about learning, growing, and building a community through writing. We’re still figuring things out, but that’s part of the fun—improving little by little while giving people a space to blog freely.<br /><br />
  So, whether you’re here to read, write, or just look around, we’re glad you stopped by. Let’s make this journey together, one blog at a time.
